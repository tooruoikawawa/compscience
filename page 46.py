1. A test case uses a set of conditions or inputs to test a piece of code.
2. The purpose of running code with test cases is to test a range of values or inputs to cover all the possible values that
    could be entered.
3. ID, description, test data, expected result, actual result, pass y/n
4. The difference is that the expected value is the correct value and the actual value is the output of the code.
5. The golden rule is that the expected result mujst never be taken from the output of the code
6. Code coverage is covering every case of the code
7. Equivalence partitions are a techique that partitions the range of conditions/inputs in areas that should have the
    same behaviour
8. Extreme values are really high numbers
9. Testing boundary values involves testing values in the region where partitions meet
10. Error anticipation is knowing that the code will have a bug or wil go wrong
11. There may be a higher number than there should be inputted
12. To prevent bugs
